[PRINCIPLE:CORE]
rule: "Research patterns first, test second"
pyramid[3]
  1. Many unit tests (fast, isolated)
  2. Some integration tests (components)
  3. Few e2e tests (critical paths)

[DACE:RULES]
mandatory[4]
  WebSearch framework patterns BEFORE testing
  WebFetch official docs for API
  Replace {YEAR} with current year
  Match testing strategy to project
forbidden[3]
  Hardcoded test examples
  Outdated testing patterns
  Trust without running tests
