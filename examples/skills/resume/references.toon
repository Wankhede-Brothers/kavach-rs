[COMMANDS:KAVACH]
status: kavach status
memory: kavach memory bank
kanban: kavach memory kanban
session: kavach session init
validate: kavach session validate

[RECOVERY:STEPS]
steps[5]
  1. kavach session init (inject date, project)
  2. kavach status (verify enforcement state)
  3. kavach memory bank (load context)
  4. kavach memory kanban (load tasks)
  5. Continue from where left off

[PRINCIPLE:CORE]
rule: "Memory Bank is single source of truth"
benefits[3]
  1. Project-aware context loading
  2. No redundant file reads
  3. Instant session recovery

[DACE:RULES]
mandatory[3]
  Use kavach commands for recovery
  Query Memory Bank for context
  Never manually read memory files
forbidden[3]
  Hardcoded recovery steps
  Reading files directly
  Ignoring Memory Bank
