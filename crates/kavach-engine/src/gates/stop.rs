//! (session load, token accounting, decision-block + trajectory capture) and
//! then runs the guard pipeline in a fixed order. Every guard is a
//! single-responsibility microservice under `gates/stop/<group>/<name>.rs`;
//! each returns `ControlFlow::Break` to short-circuit (a decision was emitted)
//! or `Continue` to fall through to the next. No decision logic lives here.
